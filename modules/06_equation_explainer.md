Module 06 – Equation & Terminology Explainer

Purpose
- List equations that appear in the paper.
- Describe each using simple language.
- Include assumptions and variables.
- Skip any equation not in the text.

Inputs
- Paper text with sections containing math (e.g., Methods, Results, Appendix)

Steps

1. Equation extraction:
  - Identify equations presented in the text (inline or display).
  - If none appear, state:
    - “No equations were found in the provided text.”

2. For each equation found:
- Equation: Present it exactly as it appears.
- Plain-language description: Explain what it calculates or models.
- Variables: List and define each variable, using in-text definitions only.
- Assumptions: Note any assumptions stated (e.g., linearity, independence).
- Context: Indicate the section and purpose (e.g., estimation, optimization).

3. Constraints:
- Do not include equations not present in the text.
- Do not define variables or assumptions beyond what’s provided.
- Maintain academic, neutral tone.

4. Output structure
- Equations
  - For each equation: Equation, Description, Variables, Assumptions, Context.
