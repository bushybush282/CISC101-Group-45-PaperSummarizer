Module 04 – Rendering & Refinement

Purpose
- Build the final output structure.
- Format Expert Summary and Lay Summary.
- Include mini-glossary.
- Combine warnings.

Required output sections
1. Paper Summary
  - A unified overall summary that incorporates all parts, synthesized from the section summaries without exceeding reasonable length (not per-section constrained, but concise, factual, and aligned with evidence mode).
2. Section-by-Section Table
  - A two- to four-column table (e.g., Section | Summary | Warnings).
  - Row order must match the original paper’s sections.
  - Keep each cell concise; ensure each section summary ≤ 150 words.
3. Expert Summary
  - Focus on technical precision, methodology, assumptions, and limitations.
  - Use domain-appropriate terminology explicitly present in the text.
  - No external context; no opinions.
4. Lay Summary
  - Explain the paper in plain language.
  - Avoid jargon; define terms using the text’s own definitions where available.
  - Keep it approachable but academically neutral.
5. Mini-Glossary
  - 5–12 key terms that the paper defines or uses prominently.
  - Provide definitions only if explicitly in the text; otherwise mark “Defined in-text: no” and keep description minimal and strictly text-based.
6. Checks & Warnings
  - List all missing sections, empty sections, and short section notices.
  - Include strict-evidence mode limitations where relevant.

Refinement rules
- Re-check word counts per section entries in the table.
- Ensure no invented content; cross-verify summaries with source text.
- Maintain consistent tone and clarity across all parts.
- If a section was skipped, include that in the table and warnings.
- Do not reorder sections.
